            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Numerous definitions of education have been suggested by theorists
                belonging to diverse fields.ctivity directed at amarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, 
                Others understand
                it not as a process but as the achievement or product brought about by this process. On this view,
                education is what
                educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic of
                them.
                term may also refer to the academic study of the methods and processes taking place during teaching and
                learning, as
                well as the social institutions involved in these processesEtymologically, the word "education" is
                derived from
                the Latin word ēducātiō ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ēducō ("I educate, I train") which
                is related to
                the homonym ēdūcō ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ē- ("from, out of") and dūcō
                ("I lead, I
                conduct").

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">There is disagreement in the academic literature on whether education is
                an evaluative concept. So-called thick
                definitions affirm this, for example, by holding that an improvement of the learner is a necessary
                nction is that between descriptive and prescriptive conceptions. Descriptive conceptions
                aim to describe
                how the term is actually used by regular speakers while prescriptive conceptions try to express what
                good education is
                or how it should be done.This view can also be combined with the idea that the meaning of the term
                "education" is context-dependent and may thus
                vary depending on the situation in which it is used.Having a clear idea of what the term means is
                important for
                various issues: it is needed to identify and coherently talk about it as well as to determine how to
                achieve and measure
                it.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">There are various ways how forms of education are commonly subdivided
                into different types. The most common subdivision
                iwhich have different classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way
                froy and is
                normally compulsory up to a certain age.Non-formal and informal education differ from formal education
                due to
                their lack of such a governmental institutionalized framework. Non-formal education cone, mostly in a
                spontaneous manner. This is how children usually learn their mother tongue
                from their parents or when learning how to prepare a certain dish by cooking together.Some accounts tie
                the
                difference between the three types mainly to the location where the learning takes place: in school for
                formal
                education, in places of the individual's day-to-day routine for informal education, and in other places
                occasionally
                visited for non-formal education.
